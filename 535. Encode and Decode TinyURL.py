# Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
# TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

# Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

class Codec:

    def __init__(self):
        self.urls = []

    def encode(self, longUrl):
        self.urls.append(longUrl)
        return 'http://tinyurl.com/' + str(len(self.urls) - 1)

    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        return self.urls[int(shortUrl.split('/')[-1])]
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
